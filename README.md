* output_test: This is a simple loop which iterates through a sequence of CC values so that you can test the output jacks.  It will set all outputs to CC values 0, 32, 64, 96 and 128 in sequence with a 2s delay between.  This should correspond roughly to 0v, 2.5v, 5v, 7.5v and 10v on the output jacks.
